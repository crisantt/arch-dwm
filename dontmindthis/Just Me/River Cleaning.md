Who is River Cleaning?
- Mold SRL specializes in the design and production of high-precision plastic molds, mainly for the automotive and aerospace sectors.
- Mold SRL company has always focused on technology and quality, honing engineering and manufacturing skills.
- With their solid foundation they were able to turn this innovative idea into a possible solution.

Improvements with the design
- Placement of Pillars to river banks, instead na sa tubig ilagay yung pillars or yung poste, sa riverbank nalang ilagay para mas maiwasan ang mabilis na pag corrode ng poste
- Changing of materials used, gagamit ng marine grade stainless steel instead of the normal steel / mild steel, kasi some rivers / lakes become salty sa specific season
	- why?
		- Because of Microplastic Release and UV Degradation
		- Plastic doesn’t fully decompose—it only breaks into smaller pieces.
		- which led to long-term environmental hazards compared to metals or natural materials.

Current features
- automatic barrier control
- sensors
- uses renewable energy
- a system that checks the status of the floating devices

Added features
- Integrating AI to the sensors to improve accuracy
	- Freshwater fish sensors para hindi ma hugot pa akyat yung mga isda and maka daan sila
- Water level sensor and warning system
	- kagaya po nung ndrrmc rainfall alert, using the water level sensor po it will track kung gaano kataas yung tubig or kababa and kapag umabot sa critical level and magsesend ito ng warning message kagaya nung sa ndrrmc rainfall warning
- Self leveling system
